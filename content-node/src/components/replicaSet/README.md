This folder is for all replica set components.

The `replicaSetController.js` file contains routing logic for all replica set component services.

Currently the only component is the `URSMRegistrationComponentService`.
Eventually we should move all sync related logic into this folder as components.

Note "URSM" = UserReplicaSetManager, which is the L2 contract for user replica set state management.
