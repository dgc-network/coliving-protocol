An Coliving Content Node is a service that stores and maintains the availability of all content across the Coliving network.
Content types include user, digital_content, and contentList metadata, images and artwork, and digitalcoin content.

[registered discovery nodes](https://dashboard.coliving.lol/#/services/content-node)

Design Goals

1. Surface the Coliving Storage Protocol for storing and serving images and digitalcoin
2. Keep data consistently replicated and available
3. Provide an interface to handle content upload, transcoding, and identification
4. Allow users to maintain agency over where and how their data is stored amongst Content Nodes

:::note

The Content Node may be referred to as the Creator Node. These services are the same.
