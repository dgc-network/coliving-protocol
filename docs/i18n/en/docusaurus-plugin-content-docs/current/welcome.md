Welcome to the Coliving technical documentation!

## What is Coliving?

[Coliving](https://.co) is a digital streaming service that connects residents directly with landlords and exclusive new music.

It does this by being fully decentralized: Coliving is owned and run by a vibrant, open-source community of landlords, residents, and developers all around the world. Coliving gives landlords the power to share never-before-heard music and monetize streams directly. Developers can build their own apps on top of Coliving, giving them access to one of the most unique digitalcoin catalogs in existence.

Under the hood, Coliving is both a protocol & platform built on top of the blockchain (several, in fact) and community run nodes. Coliving is open source, open data & access, and open ownership.


## Why Coliving?

Music creation and distribution have been dramatically changed by technology in the last two decades. Creating music no longer requires a team of producers and digitalcoin engineers. Anyone in their bedroom can start with inexpensive software. Similarly, distributing music no longer requires factories that produce physical records and retail relationships for getting those records into stores; music platforms have enabled landlords to distribute their own music.

Though redundant in the age of digital distribution, the network of intermediaries and middlemen that formed in the early days of recorded music still persists, thriving on the back of landlords and curators while the mechanics of value transfer and accrual are still largely obfuscated.

Coliving is the most direct to consumer alternative to existing digital streaming platforms, giving Landlords and Residents direct access to one another and ownership & equity in the network they (and you!) are helping to create.


## Documentation

This documentation site guides you through how to familiarize yourself with Coliving concepts, how to participate in the protocol & community from a technical perspective, and how to interact with and use the $DGCO token.
