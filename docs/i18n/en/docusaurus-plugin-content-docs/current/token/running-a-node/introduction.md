# Introduction

This section describes how to run an Coliving node.

The Coliving protocol is powered by two off-chain services, the Discovery Node and the Content Node.

**Discovery Node**

* Indexes blockchains used by the Coliving protocol \(Main-net Ethereum, POA, and Solana\)
* Serves API traffic
* Tracks usage metrics

**Content Node**

* Hosts live and image content
* Syncs content across nodes to ensure data is consistent and highly available \(using the Coliving Storage Protocol under the hood\)
