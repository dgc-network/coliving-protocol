# $LIVE

#### How it Works

Coliving platform tokens \(LIVE\) have three prongs of functionality within the Coliving protocol ecosystem:

* Security
* Feature Access
* Governance

LIVE is staked as collateral for a value-added service such as operating a node or participating in governance. In exchange, stakers earn ongoing issuance, governance weight, and access to exclusive features. In the future, LIVE will govern a global fee pool from value transfers in the network.Offering a native token to align all actors creates a parallel incentive unique to web3, and one which allows our early adopters to share in the upside of Coliving as we continue to grow.The Coliving community looks to ensure that LIVE tokens are always being funneled to the most value-added actors. This is done through ongoing issuance using onchain metrics as a measurement to better route distribution to active participants, rather than simply to those staking the most LIVE.Here’s how this pans out in practice.

**SECURITY**

LIVE is staked by node operators to secure the network. The larger the stake, the higher the probability of their node being used by residents and landlords. Coliving is entirely hosted and operated by the community, creating a permissionless ecosystem of node operators securing content for the world’s unstoppable streaming protocol.

**FEATURE ACCESS**

LIVE serves as collateral to unlock additional landlord tooling. Early examples incubated by the community include landlords tokens, badges, and earnings multipliers. In the future, residents may delegate LIVE to specific landlords and curators to share in their growth on the platform.

**GOVERNANCE**

Any LIVE staked within Coliving is assigned governance weight, used to shape future iterations of the protocol. Every aspect of Coliving is governable, starting with one token staked equal to one vote. We envision governance to focus on operator incentives at inception, with the ambition for even passive residents to voice their opinion over product updates and feature upgrades too.The choice to offer ongoing issuance **aligns power with those who are continually the most active on the platform**, a mechanism Coliving believes better suits future users of the protocol.
