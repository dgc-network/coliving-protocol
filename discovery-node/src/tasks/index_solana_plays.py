"""
Processing of plays through the Solana TrackListenCount program is handled differently
than the original indexing layer

Below we monitor the on chain 'programId' which is passed as a config - this will
be deployed exactly once to Solana in conjunction with the ColivingEthRegistry

Each transaction here is signed by a trusted ethereum address authorized within the coliving
protocol.

Monitoring the address is performed by leveraging the `get_signatures_for_address`
function, which accepts 'limit' and 'before' parameters which are key to the logic below.
This function returns tx signatures processed by the programId in confirmation order,
with the most recently confirmed returned first.

For example, if there are 1000 transactions and we request with a limit of 1000, the returned
array will have the following format:
[1000th, 999th, ..., 3rd, 2nd, 1]

This indexing logic leverages the above to monitor the 'slots' for each transaction, based on
the highest value currently stored in the discovery database and comparing that with the slots
of the latest returned transactions until an intersection is explicitly found between the two.

In the startup case, where there are no DB records present an intersection is considered 'found'
when there are no records remaining - indicating that we have reached the end of the transaction
history for this particular programId.

For example, given the following state:

latest_processed_slot = 200 <- latest slot stored in database

last_tx_signature = None <- None by design, as we must start querying the most recent chain
transactions

transactions_history = get_signatures_for_address(before=None) =
[
    sig300, slot=230,
    sig299, slot=230
    sig298, slot=229
    ...
    sig250, slot=210
]
Since no intersection has been found, the above is loaded as a single 'batch' into an array of
tx_signature batches that now has the following state:

tx_batches = [batch_300_to_250]

Now, last_tx_signature = sig250
transactions_history = get_signatures_for_address(before=None) =
[
    sig250, slot=210
    sig249, slot=209
    sig248, slot=209
    ...
    sig202, slot=201
    sig201, slot=200 <-- slot intersection
]

Here, we continue storing each transaction in a new 'batch' array until a tx with a
slot equal to the latest_processed_slot is found - in this case, 200.

Additionally, once an equivalent slot is found we explicitly validate that sig201 is present in
the local DB - if not, processing continues until an explicit signature + slot intersection is
found or no history is remaining

At this point, tx_batches = [batch_300_to_250, batch_250_to_200]

tx_batches is reversed in order to apply the oldest transactions first - as follows:

tx_batches = [batch_250_to_200, batch_300_to_250]

Each batch is then processed in parallel and committed to the local database.

It is important to note that we also limit the maximum size of tx_batches to ensure that this array
does not grow unbounded over time and new discovery nodes are able to safely recover all information.
This is performed by simply slicing the tx_batches array and discarding the newest transactions until an intersection
is found - these limiting parameters are defined as TX_SIGNATURES_MAX_BATCHES, TX_SIGNATURES_RESIZE_LENGTH
