# Discovery Node
An Coliving Discovery Node is a service that indexes the contents of the Coliving contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, for Coliving users to query. The indexed content includes user, digital_content, and other information along with social features. The data is stored for quick access, updated on a regular interval, and made available for clients via a RESTful API.

For detailed instructions on how to develop on the service, please see [The Wiki](https://github.com/dgc-network/coliving-protocol/wiki/Discovery-Node-‚Äê-How-to-run#running-for-development).
