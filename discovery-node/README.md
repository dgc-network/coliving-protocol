# Discovery Node
An Coliving Discovery Node is a service that indexes the contents of the Coliving contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, for Coliving users to query. The indexed content includes user, agreement, and other information along with social features. The data is stored for quick access, updated on a regular interval, and made available for clients via a RESTful API.

For detailed instructions on how to develop on the service, please see [The Wiki](https://github.com/dgc-network/coliving-protocol/wiki/Discovery-Provider-‚Äê-How-to-run#running-for-development).
