# Coliving Identity Service

The identity service maintains all the identity aspects of the Coliving ecosystem such as storing encrypted auth ciphertexts, doing Twitter oauth and relay transactions on behalf of users

This repo is based on the coliving-network-node repo with very similar structure and modules. Read [the wiki](https://github.com/AudiusProject/coliving-protocol/wiki/Identity-Service:-Overview) for more info.
