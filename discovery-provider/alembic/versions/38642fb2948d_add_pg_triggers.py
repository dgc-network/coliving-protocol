"""add pg trigger for aggregate plays

This migration updates the DB to use a pg trigger to update the
aggregate_plays table instead of using a celery task
1. Update the aggreagate_plays table to be up to date
   This provides consistency and is a precursor to updating
   the table via pg triggers
2. Create the handle_play function to increment the play item's count
3. Register the function as a pg trigger on insert to plays table
